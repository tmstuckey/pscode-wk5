// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

NUMBER num1, num2, sum
    
    INPUT num1
     INPUT num2
    sum = num1 + num2
    OUTPUT sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

   NUMBER num
    OUTPUT("100")
    INPUT num
    IF num 2 == 0 THEN
        OUTPUT "Even"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "Odd"
    ELSE IF

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

    ARRAY numbers[5]
    NUMBER sum, count, average, smallest, largest
    sum = 0
    count = 0
    OUTPUT("Enter a number (enter -1 to stop):")
    INPUT numbers[count]
    WHILE numbers[count] != -1 DO
        sum = sum + numbers[count]
        count = count + 1
        OUTPUT("Enter a number (enter -1 to stop):")
        INPUT numbers[count]
    END WHILE
    IF count > 0 THEN
        average = sum / count
        smallest = numbers[0]
        largest = numbers[0]
        FOR i FROM 1 TO count-1 DO
            IF numbers[i] < smallest THEN
                smallest = numbers[i]
            END IF
            IF numbers[i] > larger THEN
                largest = numbers[i]
            END IF
        END FOR
        OUTPUT("Average:", average)
        OUTPUT("Smallest:", smallest)
        OUTPUT("Largest:", largest)
    ELSE
        OUTPUT("No numbers were entered.")
    END
Answers: 
In exercise number two we wanted to show if a number was even or odd, I used IF/ELSE/ ELSE IF  IF to   show if the  number was 2==0 it would print out EVEN and if not it will print out ODD.
 In exercise 3  there would be an array of five numbers I used IF/THEN AND IF/ELSE/ ELSE IF statements to set up pseudo set code.
